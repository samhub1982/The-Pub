The Pub:
A private social network for family and friends:

Launch features will include:
1. Profiles
		They will be more limited than what you are used to. This is mainly 
		because we will all know each other (for the most part).
2. Avatars (aka your profile picture)
		You will have to upload this seperate from your photo gallery. There 
		are some things that I need to cut back on a bit to make this come out 
		sooner.
3. Status updates
		It will be messagin with a twitter style. I don't intend on limiting 
		the size of your update/post. As of me writing this readme I am still 
		figuring out how I plan on implementing this. There will be a status 
		feed.
4. Private messages
		I plan on making this an "inbox" style of messaging.
5. Photo Gallery
		As of writing this I am still trying to figure out how I would like to 
		implement this. This will probably happen once I get home.
6. A mobile view of the website:
		This is used so when you access the website via a mobile phone browser 
		it will load a smaller version of the page. While this will be a 
		permanant feature it is actually only a temporary stop gap for when 
		(and if) I decide to make an Android and Apple App.

Possible future features (not limited to):
1. A chat function
2. Events (ie birthdays)
3. A large Ajax implementation
4. Videos

There are still a lot of things that I need to figure out:
1. How to privatize the site
		a. Create a site code
		b. Only allow signups after an existing user has sent an invite
2. How I am going to create and implement a user photo gallery.
3. How I am going to implement a reply function to status updates.
4. For that matter, I still need to iron out how to store user uploaded 
		files.

What this site is all about:
This site is being created to provide my family and all of our friends a 
more private means to communicate amongst each other. Facebook and MySpace 
have been great for that but I thought it could be better. So I have set 
out to make a completely private social network for us.

Disclaimer:
The only disclaimer that I can really think of is that I am pouring quite 
a lot of effort into this site. I have made quite a few websites in the 
past but this one is, by far, the most complex. It will also come with a 
monthly fee. With that being said, if I do not get a following that 
warrents the monthly fee then I am pulling the site down. If I don't get 
a good enough following then I will not continue to improve on the site. 
In other words, if there aren't enough active users then what is the point 
of me creating mobile apps, writing a chat function, implementing a ton of 
Ajax to make the site nearly seemless, or working on implementing user 
videos? Well, I don't see one. So, if you are truly interested in the site 
then the way to support it would be use it!
